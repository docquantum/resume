I write daemons that don't just runâ€”they infiltrate. From ICE-breaking algorithms to full-stack web apps, I'm the netrunner you want when results matter. Don't waste my time with corpo-speak; let's flatline obstacles and ship something sharp.
<#else>
Elite software engineer focused on cyber defense, ICE-breaking technology, and optimized embedded systems for high-security environments. Proven ability to deploy rapid, reliable solutions while enhancing code development and operational processes.

[ Software Daemon Engineer ]{.position}
[ 2077--present ]{#present .date}
]{.subtext}

- #### Net-Intrusion Daemon Development
Authored state-of-the-art ICE-breaking daemons in Rust capable of penetrating Militech's 4th-gen military defense systems. These daemons ensured secure corporate espionage and covert data exfiltration.

- #### Embedded Systems Engineering
Developed firmware for high-security cybernetic implants in C on a custom Arasaka ARM platform, incorporating next-gen quantum encryption and real-time diagnostics over a custom Netwatch-restricted comm stack.

- #### Database & API Management
Engineered optimized C/C++ storage modules for neuro-mapped data extraction from cyberbrain implants, integrating it into black-site testing labs. Maintained covert REST API endpoints for secure data flow between Arasaka outposts.

- #### Hardware-Software Integration
Led a multi-disciplinary team in developing next-gen ICEbreakers, synchronizing code and hardware across various platforms (RaspberryPi-based netrunners, Arasaka Zero-One servers). Integrated fault-tolerant neural network learning capabilities.

- #### Cryptographic Optimization
Re-engineered black-box cryptographic routines for OTA firmware updates on secure cybernetic devices, reducing execution time by 40% while ensuring minimal footprint for stealth installations on low-resource cyberimplants.

- #### Process Improvement
Implemented containerized virtual environments via Docker for secure and reproducible code deployment, minimizing detection risks during Arasaka's black ops.

- #### Legacy System Integration
Reverse-engineered ancient Militech firmware running on pre-collapse systems, writing custom Z180-based emulators to deploy covert backdoor access for future operations.

- #### Client Coordination
Collaborated with high-profile clients in Night City's underworld to deliver bespoke software solutions tailored to their highly specific security needs. Provided continuous updates and troubleshooting for deployed daemons.

### **University of Night City, Autonomous Research Lab**
[ [ Senior Netrunner Research Assistant ]{.position} [ 2075--2077 ]{.date} ]{.subtext}

- Deployed an advanced neural network on a Netwatch-grade supercomputer for corporate espionage purposes, optimizing for high-latency urban surveillance.
- Developed a C# Unity application for generating synthetic data to train deep learning algorithms on predicting underground syndicate activity.
- Continuously enhanced the system's accuracy in detecting subversive communications and secret weapon shipments across the combat zone.
- Created real-time 3D demos using Unity and WebGL to simulate complex data interception techniques, for training upcoming netrunners in Arasaka's educational programs.
- Designed a Unity tool for visualizing data siphoned from illegal Militech drones for further analysis and integration into Arasaka's defense network.
